To support both DOC and DOCX files on Windows, where the script can leverage Microsoft Word via comtypes, the script provided does the job. The comtypes library allows automation through the Microsoft Word application to open and convert files into PDFs.

1. Environment: This script is intended for use on Windows because it relies on comtypes to automate Microsoft Word.

2. Usage: Ensure that Microsoft Word is installed and configured correctly on your machine. The automation of Word is required for this conversion to work (Word must be accessible).

3. Dependencies:
   - comtypes provides the capability to automate Windows applications like Microsoft Word.
   - wxPython is used to present the file dialog.
  
 Installation:
   `pip install wxPython comtypes`
